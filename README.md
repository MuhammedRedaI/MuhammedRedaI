Hi there 👋

Hello! My name is Muhammed Reda, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at the Canadian International University in Egypt.

I’m currently a Cloud Intern at Cloudypedia
, where I’m gaining real-world experience in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I hold a Google Cloud Certified Cloud Solution Engineer credential, and I’m building a strong foundation across cloud architecture, DevOps, networking, and security.

Right now, I’m completing the Google Cloud Solution Architect learning path, with plans to continue with:

GCP DevOps Engineer

GCP Network Engineer

GCP Security Engineer

Alongside certifications, I’m working on hands-on cloud projects to strengthen my practical expertise.
